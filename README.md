# Data Structure Practice with Javascript

This repo contains various problems pertaining to data structures and will be solved using Javascript syntax. All of the problems and most of its solutions are found on [this Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/coding-interview-bootcamp-algorithms-and-data-structure/learn/v4/overview).

Note that solutions can be copied and pasted onto the browser console and tested with their accompanying examples or test case. They should work, unless I mucked something up.
